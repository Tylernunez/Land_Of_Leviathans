CURRENT GOAL: The Rat Quest

	Create a proof of concept that Land of Leviathans is a study worth continuing by following in the footsteps of the greats before you. Make the Rat Quest.

Some person has a rat problem and hires our intrepid adventurer to deal with the problem, however the rat quest is always more complex than it lets on to be.

Who give the quest initially?
Who offers a reward for an outcome to the quest?
Does the result of this quest influence any factions?

Whatever area is required for the quest to work will be created, NPCs and monsters required will also be created. 

TODO:
Create map of quest, have beginning and end as endpoints
From the created map, branch based on application of attributes and perhaps skills
Map all these branches to somewhere near the endpoint, where different outcomes were the result of attributes and skills used.
